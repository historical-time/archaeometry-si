Thank you for your interest in our special online issue on Computational Archaeology.

All submissions should be made online via the Archeometry Scholar One portal at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/arch. If you do not have an account it is very easy to set one up. Please use your ORCID  if possible.

Papers for the Computational Archaeology special issue should be between 4,000 and  9,000 words. As this is an online special issue, you can include as many additional files such as figures, tables, maps and appendices. Any images which are part of the main paper should be submitted as individual files and not included in the main document, use the captions to show where they should be placed in the published paper. These files should all be submitted in an editable format so that they can be resized to fit the published paper. This includes `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.jpg`, `.rtf`, `.tex` but should not include PDFs.

Supplementary material which does not need to be typeset or edited can be in any format including PDFs and audio and video files.

Archaeometry has a 'mandates data' policy which means that we require all the data which supports your paper to be included, ideally as supplementary material or a link to the data. See https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/data-sharing-citation/data-sharing-policy.html for further information. We can include full tables and further details of methodology, control data, coding information and information on laboratory equipment.  As you submit your paper please include a data statement which tells readers where to find the supporting data.

Regarding Open Access, Archaeometry is a hybrid journal. Authors can pay a processing charge for their paper to be fully open access as soon as it is published (gold Open Access) the processing charge for this is: $3,190 £2,160 €2,620, or opt for Green Open Access whereby a PDF of the paper as accepted can be deposited in a University or similar repository with a one year embargo period.
Your institution may already have an agreement in place which covers your paper’s Open Access fee without you needing to do anything, see here https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/affiliation-policies-payments/institutional-funder-payments.html 

Papers should be submitted in the first instance by  Insert date. After reviewing you will be asked for any revisions that have been advised and should submit these as soon as possible.

The special issue is scheduled for April 2024?  However, papers will be published in Early View as they are accepted and are then a published citable paper.
