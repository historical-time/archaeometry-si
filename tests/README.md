## Building LOD

For each archaeological event or duration, dated by **absolute chronology**, the minimal required information for each sample are the Peuquet's triad dimensions (What, When, Where):

| What | When | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| Thera-Santorini volcano eruption | -2000/-1500 | Egean sea |

If the archeological event has a relative chronology, i.e. is dated relatively to another event, this relationship should be mentionned using temporal logic:

| What | When | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| Thera-Santorini volcano eruption | *before* Minoean palace collapse | Egean sea |
| Minoean palace collapse | -1450 | Egean sea |

In both cases the format for temoral data (*When*) should be, as possible, the [EDTF](https://github.com/historical-time/archaeometry-si#edtf)
