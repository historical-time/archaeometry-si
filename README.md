## Submission guidelines

Thank you for your interest in our Archaeometry online special issue: ***'Chronology: formal methods and research software in Archeaology'*** (working title).

All submissions should be made online via the Archaeometry Scholar One portal at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/arch. If you do not have an account, it is very easy to set one up. Please use your ORCID if possible.

Papers should be between 4,000 and 9,000 words. As this is an online special issue, you can include as many additional files such as figures, tables, maps and appendices. Any images which are part of the main paper should be submitted as individual files and not included in the main document, use the captions to show where they should be placed in the published paper. These files should all be submitted in an editable format so that they can be resized to fit the published paper. This includes `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.jpg`, `.rtf`, `.tex` but should not include PDFs. Except for the above instructions, your manuscript should conform to the [journal's author guidelines](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14754754/homepage/forauthors.html).

Supplementary material which does not need to be typeset or edited can be in any format including PDFs, audio and video files.

To experience FAIR research[^2] on temporal data, and possibly to publish a collective paper on this topic, we are developing a GitHub repository dedicated to this special issue: https://github.com/historical-time/archaeometry-si. All authors willing to share samples of their data or computer scripts are welcome to do so: either by hosting these samples on their own GitHub or by adding them to https://github.com/historical-time/data-samples [^1].

Archaeometry has a 'mandates data' policy which means that we require all the data which supports your paper to be included, ideally as supplementary material or a link to the data. See https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/data-sharing-citation/data-sharing-policy.html for further information. We can include full tables and further details of methodology, control data, coding information and information on laboratory equipment. As you submit your paper, please include a data statement which tells readers where to find the supporting data.

Regarding Open Access, Archaeometry is a hybrid journal. Authors can pay a processing charge for their paper to be fully open access as soon as it is published (Gold Open Access). The processing charge for this is: $3,190 | £2,160 | €2,620 or opt for Green Open Access whereby a PDF of the paper as accepted can be deposited in a University or similar repository with a one-year embargo period.
Your institution may already have an agreement in place which covers your paper’s Open Access fee without you needing to do anything (see https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/affiliation-policies-payments/institutional-funder-payments.html).

Papers should be submitted in the first instance by Friday **November 17, 2023**. All papers will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. Reviews and decision of acceptance will be sent to authors by Friday **February 16, 2024**. Revised papers will be due by Monday **April 29, 2024**.

The full special issue is scheduled for publication on Monday **June 17, 2024** (see [timetable](#timeline)). However, papers will be published in Early View as they are accepted and will then be citable as published papers.

## Data samples

We invite authors to upload samples of their data to this GitHub repository: [data-samples/](https://github.com/historical-time/data-samples#examples-of-historical-time-representation). The aim is to align heterogeneous time data used in the special issue using [CIDOC-CRM](https://github.com/historical-time/projects-tools-standards/tree/main/standards/cidoc-crm), [EDTF](https://github.com/historical-time/projects-tools-standards/tree/main/standards/edtf) -- or any convenient standards -- and possibly to publish a collective paper on this topic
